## Name Of the Application: Slack-chat
## Tool used: 
    Vscode, 
    Next FrameWork,
    ShadCn/ui components,
    Convex --> for Managing Our Database, Authentication.

## App progress:

[26th Sept 2024]
-- Have setup the next FrameWork and have also added ShadCn support, That provides configurable components.
-- New folder --> features 
    - created under src.
    - Holds a folder --> auth [ecerything releated to auth i.e hooks, api calls, components and screen]
-- Pages marked as "use client" --> means that page is a react component not a react server component
    - react component: 
        Rendered by the browser i.e the client, have access to react-hooks like useStatet and useEffect and DOM objects.
        use:
            - When need interactivity or dynamic content. Have to handle state and make API calls.
            - eg: search Functionality.
    - react server component: 
        - These are rendered on the server and sent to the client.
        - faster compared to client-rendered. No access to react hooks. 
        use:
            - no interactivity needed, pre-rendered HTML need to sent to client i.e static content.
            - blog post or product-list page --> After loaded no change or interaction needed.

[28th Sept 2024]
-- Completed the basic layout for SignUp and SignIn Page.
-- Using and setting up convex [Database Manager] --> ** This has to be always running in a seperate terminal, to have access to database **
    --> Convex is the real-time database. i.e as soon as you update the database in backend, it will refelect in the client.

NOTE:
-- If parents are "use client" i.e client component --> Doesn't necessary means all it's children has to be clien too.
-- They can have server component as children, as long as they are passed using children prop.

** Basic Routing in Next App:
    -- Under app folder --> crate a new folder eg: test --> add a new file eg: page.tsx.
    -- Thus, now the above file open at: localhost:3000/test
    -- NOTE: 
        - page.tsx cannot have named export i.e export const page = () => {...} 
        - It must have default export. i.e const page = () => {...} export default page;

** Implementing Auth using Convex Auth
    -- For Setting up convex --> follow the Docs. [https://docs.convex.dev/quickstart/nextjs]
    -- Just Follow the ConvexAuth Docs. [https://labs.convex.dev/auth/setup]
    -- Make sure you maintain the File-structure carefully and also Handles the import and export of Modules properly.
